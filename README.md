# moreDataStructures - The repository for a bunch of Structure Stuff
This repository contains a variety of different data structures which can be used in various instances. Beginning with linked Lists, this repository will be gradually filled with different functional data structures (stacks, heaps, trees, graphs, etc.) The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference point for the construction of various data structures.

## Currently Implemented Structures
